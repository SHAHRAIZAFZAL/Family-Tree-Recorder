# Family-Tree-Recorder
The Family Tree Recorder is a C++ program designed to help users manage and document family relationships in a structured manner. It allows users to add new family members, define relationships such as parent-child and siblings, search for specific individuals, and display the entire family tree hierarchy. The program offers an interactive menu that makes it easy to navigate through different options and update the family tree dynamically. By organizing relationships systematically, this tool serves as a useful resource for keeping track of family lineage and connections.
